Perian is a QuickTime component incorporating libavcodec and friends from the
ffmpeg project along with code from the old FFusion component and 
AVIImporter.component. The code is available under the GPL. The project site
is located at <http://trac.cod3r.com/perian/> and the project subversion
repository is located at <http://svn.cod3r.com/perian/>.

Currently Perian supports most AVI files. I've found one AVI that doesn't
quite play back correctly (audio issues), but other than that it's been reliable.
It should cleanly support both XviD and DivX encoded AVI files along with some
other minor flavors.

To use Perian, simply place it in /Library/QuickTime or ~/Library/QuickTime. For
ease of installation, a symlink to /Library/QuickTime has been provided on the
disk image.

This is a prerelease-ish version of Perian, bugs will happen, and the final
feature set should grow dramatically.

Thanks to:
JŽr™me Cornet and his FFusion project for giving me the idea and 
	code to start from
Christoph NŠgeli's AVI Importer from his XviD component, which
	allowed us to leverage libavformat
All the people that put up with my insane requests for help and free testing,
	notably MartianSteve from #macsb for the first ICBM test, and Graham Booker
	for joining up with me and fixing the build every time I add a feature and
	then run off somewhere like the overcommitted madman I am.
